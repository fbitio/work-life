General ideas about making office job more healthy and enjoyable

## Staying disciplined and persistent
Discipline and persistence are the two fundamentals on which your work and life should be based. Without them you will not be able to achieve your desires or make significant changes in your daily rut. 
Discipline should be practised at every occasion, with full and honest immerse into your actions, complete focus and conscious decisions.
Persistence is the willingness to continue through hard, low and uncertain moments in the daily events.

Once discipline and persistence checks are in place you can move on to implementing the daily hacks to your life.

### Inner changes (TODO: to expand)
- Sleep. Find the right amount of sleep and be very strict with the times (e.g. 9 hours sleep from 10pm to 7am, there is no right or wrong number here, just listen to your body)
- Diet
  - Avoid Caffeine, green/black tea and other stimulants. Get a shot of energy followed by lows. Withdrawal takes time but it's worth it
  - Avoid Alcohol and other depressants. Completely unnecessary drink promising relaxing time (e.g. whisky) or fun time (e.g. beer). You get hangovers, headaches, lack of control over yourself and your physical gains seem to get compromised.
  - Avoid added sugars. Substitute it with fresh fruits. Sugar gives blood spikes and yes, it makes food tasty good. But is very addictive and unnecessary.
- Exercising. Keeping yourself healthy.
  - Cycle everytime and everywhere you can.
- Hobies or something that you enjoy. So that you have fun and have great time during your day.
- Partner, family and friends. Make time for all of them but cut ties with the ones who don't contribute anything to your life or make it worse.
- Being outdoors. Getting sunlight, enjoying the rain, or cold.
- Chase experiences over things. Experiences make impact on your life and make you a richer person. Things are not.
- Minimalism. Focus on the things that give you value to your life. Get rid of the rest. It also helps you to think what is important for you.
  
### Outer changes
- Mobile phone
  - No games. It's a waste of time and their are finite. (You should be aiming for infinite games in life)
  - No notifications. Just unimportant distractions.
- Internet
  - No social network or constant checking for NEWS. Infinite scrolls and new content on Reddit are waste of time. You hardly remember anything you read and it doesn't improve your life substantially. 
  - When reading news sites that are not very focused like HN be clear with what interests you and what you want to learn like latest development in particular technology.

### Work
- Don't get stuck. If you don't understand something always seeks help or try to learn about it.
- Make daily small progress. Your small progress accumulates over time and remember that what you do daily counts rather than big work you do once in a while.
- Have very specific and small tasks that are self explanatory.
- Set a limit on maximum parallel projects and dedicate your full attention to them (Currently maxed out at 5 projects)
- Stop starting and start finishing! Finishing is the key but be very honest and clear what finish means to you.

### Keep learning
- Keep reading. Stop reading if something is boring and focus on interesting books.
- Be conscious what you read online. It may overspill with your time assigned for reading.
- Challenge your ideas and be flexible with new thoughts. Many notions eventually can become obsolete.
- Lear from others and have a curious mind!
